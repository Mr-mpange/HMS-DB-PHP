🔒 SECURITY NOTICE - READ THIS!
========================================

⚠️  YOUR SECRETS ARE SAFE!

When you run deploy.bat, it creates:

deployment/
├── frontend/        ← UPLOAD THIS
├── backend/         ← UPLOAD THIS
│   └── .env         ← Has PLACEHOLDERS (safe)
└── docs/            ← DO NOT UPLOAD!
    └── SECRETS_REFERENCE.txt ← Your real secrets

========================================
✅ WHAT'S SAFE TO UPLOAD:
========================================

1. deployment/frontend/*
   → Upload to public_html/

2. deployment/backend/*
   → Upload to public_html/api/
   → The .env file has PLACEHOLDERS like:
     JWT_SECRET=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_JWT_SECRET
     DB_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DB_PASSWORD

========================================
⚠️  DO NOT UPLOAD:
========================================

❌ deployment/docs/ folder
   Contains your real secrets for reference

❌ production-secrets.txt
   Your actual secrets (already in .gitignore)

❌ backend/.env.production
   Your local production config (already in .gitignore)

========================================
✅ AFTER UPLOADING TO HOSTINGER:
========================================

1. SSH to your server or use File Manager

2. Edit: public_html/api/.env

3. Replace placeholders with your real secrets:
   - Open: deployment/docs/SECRETS_REFERENCE.txt
   - Copy your JWT_SECRET
   - Copy your SESSION_SECRET
   - Copy your DB_PASSWORD
   - Paste them into the .env file on server

4. Save the file

5. Start backend: pm2 start src/server.js

========================================
🔒 SECURITY SUMMARY:
========================================

✓ Secrets are NOT in deployment package
✓ Only placeholders are uploaded
✓ You manually add secrets on server
✓ Secrets never leave your local machine
✓ .gitignore protects all secret files

========================================
✅ YOU ARE SAFE!
========================================

Your secrets will NEVER be:
- Committed to git
- Uploaded to Hostinger automatically
- Exposed in deployment package

You control when and how secrets are added!
